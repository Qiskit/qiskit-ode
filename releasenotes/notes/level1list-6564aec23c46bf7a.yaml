    The data type of memory data produced by :class:`~.DynamicsBackend` for
    measurement level 1 was changed from a Numpy array to a list in order to
    match the type documented for the ``ExperimentResultData`` class in Qiskit.
    To get the old Numpy format back, it is sufficient to call ``numpy.array``
    on the result data.
